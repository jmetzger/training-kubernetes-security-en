# Image Scanning - When ? 

## When to scan ?

  * In Development
  * When Building Software
  * Before Deploying Software
  * In Production

## Why ? 

  * We want to be sure, our syste is not compromised
  * One way of compromising is an ineffected/malicious image, we use
  * We want to avoid this.

## Which approach do we take here....

  * For our own images, that we build, we want to be sure, they are all "clean" before being pushed to the registry
